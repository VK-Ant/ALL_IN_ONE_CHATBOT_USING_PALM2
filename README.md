# **ALL IN ONE VK CHATBOT: Audio, Prompt, Multi-PDF, Vision-Based Chatbot that Integrates with Streamlit & Translates (107 Languages)**

## ***This Google Gemini chatbot is based on the LLM PALM2 Model!***

## **What & Why Palm2?**

- PaLM 2 is our next-generation large language model that builds on Googleâ€™s legacy of breakthrough research in machine learning and responsible AI.

- It excels at advanced reasoning tasks, including code and math, classification and question answering, translation and multilingual proficiency, and natural language generation better than our previous state-of-the-art LLMs, including PaLM. It can accomplish these tasks because of the way it was built â€“ bringing together compute-optimal scaling, an improved dataset mixture, and model architecture improvements.

- Palm 2 is grounded in Googleâ€™s approach to building and deploying AI responsibly. All versions of PaLM 2 are evaluated rigorously for potential harms and biases, capabilities, and downstream uses in research and in-product applications. PaLM 2 is used in other state-of-the-art models, like Sec-PaLM. We continue to implement the latest versions of PaLM 2 in generative AI tools like the PaLM API and Bard.
