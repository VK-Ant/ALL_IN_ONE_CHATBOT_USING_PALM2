# **Prompt & Vision Based Chatbot Integrating Streamlit**

## **OBJECTIVE:**

The project's goal is to create a chatbot that can quickly summarise your picture's contents and prompt-based answers.

## ***This Google Gemini chatbot is based on the LLM PALM2 Model!***

## **What & Why Palm2?**

- PaLM 2 is our next-generation large language model that builds on Googleâ€™s legacy of breakthrough research in machine learning and responsible AI.

- It excels at advanced reasoning tasks, including code and math, classification and question answering, translation and multilingual proficiency, and natural language generation better than our previous state-of-the-art LLMs, including PaLM. It can accomplish these tasks because of the way it was built â€“ bringing together compute-optimal scaling, an improved dataset mixture, and model architecture improvements.

- Palm 2 is grounded in Googleâ€™s approach to building and deploying AI responsibly. All versions of PaLM 2 are evaluated rigorously for potential harms and biases, capabilities, and downstream uses in research and in-product applications. PaLM 2 is used in other state-of-the-art models, like Sec-PaLM. We continue to implement the latest versions of PaLM 2 in generative AI tools like the PaLM API and Bard.

## **STEPS TO FOLLOW IN THIS PROJECT:**

### **1. Git clone and change directory**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/VK-Ant/Prompt_Vision_Based_Chatbot_integrating_Streamlit.git

$ cd Prompt_Vision_Based_Chatbot_integrating_Streamlit
```
Make sure the path is correct.

### **2. Install prerequisite library using requirement file**

```bash

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### **3. Add your project folder to the.env folder you created (put your Gemini api key)**

'''bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY = your Gemini API key
'''

### **4. Finally, run the code**

```bash

$ streamlit run vision_prompt_chatbot.py

```



## **PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

1. Install requirement file.

2. .Add your project folder to the.env folder you created (put your gemini api).

3. Run the main file

4. if you choose the vision model then upload the picture else just prompt and get the output
